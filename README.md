Self project [LoLStats] Website

Project Title: League of Legends Stats website

Description: a website where user can freely look up match history/Rank/Level/ other info of League of Legends Users.

Tools used: html css javascript nodejs [ejs, https, mongoose, express, body-parser, cron] mongodb_atlas, RiotGames Api

** Please note that this project has no relation with Riot Games. This is a personal project which was solely created for entertainment & self-educational purposes. 

Main Highlights: 
- Real-time data received using riot-games api
- Rankings data is stored in mongodb atlas db, which is being updated every 10 minutes 
- all user-searches are real-time. As my private api key is not public, api call frequency is limited to follow riotgames api restriction (20 calls/sec)
